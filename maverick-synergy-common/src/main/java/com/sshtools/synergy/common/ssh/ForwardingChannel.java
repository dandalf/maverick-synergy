 * <p>An abstract forwarding channel implementation for use with both local
 * and remote forwarding operations.</p>
 *
 * A forwarding channel acts as a tunnel, connections are listened for at the tunnel start point and any data is forwarded from the start point through the ssh connection and then onto the end point.
 * 
 *  Local forwards have the tunnel start point on the client, and the data flows from the start point through the client, along the ssh connection to the server, out to the endpoint which can be anywhere.
 *  Remote forwards have the tunnel start point on the Server, and the data flows from the start point through the server, along the ssh connection to the client, out to the endpoint which can be anywhere.
